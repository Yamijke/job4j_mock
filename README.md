# CheckDev Project Description

CheckDev is an innovative platform designed for mock interviews between programmers. This platform allows users to improve their knowledge and skills through interactive interviews on selected topics.

## Key Features

### Section and Topic Selection
- **Choose a Section**: A programmer can select the desired section, for example, Java.
- **Select a Topic**: After selecting a section, the programmer can choose a specific topic, such as collections.

### Creating an Interview
- **Interview Types**: The user can create a job interview, which can be of two types: either asking questions or answering questions.
- **Participation**: Other programmers can respond to this interview in a role opposite to the one chosen by the author of the interview.

### Conducting the Interview
- **Face-to-Face Interaction**: The interview author selects one of the willing interviewees and conducts a face-to-face interview with him/her.

### Feedback
- **Mutual Feedback**: After the interview is completed, both the author and the participant provide feedback on each other's knowledge of the chosen topic.
- **Two-Way Feedback**: This feedback is two-way, allowing each participant to adjust and improve their knowledge and skills based on the received comments.
